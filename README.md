## üé® Customization

### Adding New Celestial Objects
```javascript
const newObject = {
    name: 'Pluto',
    radius: 0.6,
    color: 0x8c7853,
    orbitRadius: 55,
    speed: 0.004,
    rotationSpeed: 0.01,
    description: 'Former 9th planet, now classified as a dwarf planet.',
    facts: {
        'Radius': '1,188 km',
        'Distance from Sun': '5.9 billion km',
        'Orbital Period': '248 Earth years',
        'Moons': '5 (including Charon)'
    }
};
```

### Modifying Visual Appearance
Edit `style.css` to customize:
- Panel transparency and blur effects
- Color schemes and accent colors
- Animation durations and easing
- Responsive breakpoints
- Typography and spacing

### Performance Tuning
Adjust in `script.js`:
- Star field density (`starCount` variable)
- Planet geometry complexity (`segments` parameter)
- Animation frame rate and quality
- Shadow and lighting settings
